# üìö Book Management System (NestJS)

A simple RESTful API for managing books and authors, built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) using [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/). This project demonstrates best practices in architecture, data validation, error handling, and testing.

## üöÄ Features

- Create, retrieve, update, and delete authors and books
- Search & filter support for authors and books
- Data validation with `class-validator`
- Error handling with meaningful HTTP status codes
- Pagination for listing endpoints
- Relational mapping between books and authors
- Unit & end-to-end testing

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
- **Database:** SQLite (with TypeORM)
  - **Note:** In production, I prefer **PostgreSQL** for its robustness, JSONB support, strong indexing, and advanced querying capabilities.
- **Testing:** Jest & Supertest
- **Validation:** `class-validator`, `class-transformer`
